# Serverless Solar-Panel-Monitoring-System-with-AWS
After I got familiar with core AWS services like EC2, VPCs, subnets, and more, I decided to work on my first project to gain hands-on experience in this new environment. This repository documents the goal, the key components, and implementation of that project: a serverless monitoring system for solar panel installations.

It features a web application designed to monitor and visualize real-time and historical solar panel output data, leveraging AWS services for the backend and a React frontend for data visualization.
